## Algorithm

The crossword generator uses a **backtracking** approach enhanced by the **Minimum Remaining Values (MRV)** heuristic:

1. **Select** the cell with the fewest valid word options.  
2. **Try** each candidate word in that position.  
3. **Recurse** until the grid is filled or backtrack on failure.  

This strategy minimizes the search space and yields puzzles in ~5 seconds on average.

The code for the crossword generator can be found in `generator/gen.c`.
